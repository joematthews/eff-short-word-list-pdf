This PDF is based on the [EFF's short word list](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases) used for generating passphrases using four 6-sided dice.

The PDF is formated to print very neatly on 3 double-sided US Letter size papers. A physical copy of the list could be useful for generating secure-ish passphrases discretely, offline.

## How to Use

Grab 4 six-sided dice (4d6) and roll one at a time (in series) and then take the resulting number and find the word on the list.

Repeat these steps until you create a passphrase that has enough entropy to satisfy your paranoid mind.

> [!WARNING]
> In practice, it would not be difficult to brute force a passphrase made from the short list (too few words). This can be remedied, some-what, by throwing in some symbols and captilizing the words? I advise not telling your friends you use this method. I'm not selling this very well..
